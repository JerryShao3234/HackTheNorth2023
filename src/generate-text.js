The first little pig liked to read books, the second little pig liked to play with toys, and the third little pig liked to cook. One day, a big bad bear came along and knocked on the door of their house. He said he wanted to eat the three little pigs for dinner. The first little pig was so scared that he ran all the way to his brother's house. The second little pig was so scared that he ran all the way to his sister's house. The third little pig was so scared that he ran all the way to the bear's house. The bear had a big pot of water boiling on the stove, and he was just about to drop the three little pigs into the pot when the third little pig said, "Wait! I can make a better dinner than you can." The bear was so surprised that he let the third little pig go. The third little pig went back to his house and got some food from the refrigerator. He made a big bowl of porridge and brought it to the bear's house. The bear was so happy that he ate the porridge and forgot all about eating the three little pigs. The three little pigs were so happy that they had escaped from the bear, and they lived happily ever after.

Story:
Once upon a time, a hedgehog and a frog were the best of friends. They would spend their days exploring the forest and playing games together. They were always there for each other in good times and bad. One day, while they were out exploring, they came across a big, shiny apple. The hedgehog was so excited, he ran over to the apple and started to eat it. The frog was a little more cautious, and he hopped around the apple, trying to figure out if it was safe to eat. The hedgehog had eaten almost the entire apple when he suddenly realized that it was not an apple at all, but a big, shiny mirror. He had eaten the mirror and now he had a big hole in his stomach! The frog was very worried about his friend, and he knew he had to do something to help him. He hopped over to the hedgehog and started to lick the hole in his stomach. He licked and licked until the hole was finally gone. The hedgehog was so grateful to his friend for saving him, and he promised to never eat a mirror again. From that day on, the hedgehog and the frog were closer than ever. They had learned that they could always count on each other, no matter what.

The dragon's wings were beating so hard that they were creating strong winds, and its fiery breath was turning the rain into huge bolts of lightning.
